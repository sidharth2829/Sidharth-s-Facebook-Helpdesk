# Facebook Helpdesk Testing Guide

For testing, Facebook accounts must be added as either developer or testing roles.

## Developer Facebook Account

**Id:** sidharthgrover28@gmail.com  
**Password:** Fdhelpdesk

## Tester Facebook Account

If you want to test other accounts, just add more tester accounts in developer dashboard via this Facebook Developer ID (sidharthgrover28@gmail.com).
